# MACHINE-LEARNING-BASED-PREDICTION-OF-HEART-FAILURE-READMISSION-WITH-DRUG-ANALYSIS

A statistical learning project, utilizing various preprocessing techniques and machine learning models to analyze a retrospective heart failure dataset comprising 2,008 patients from a hospital in Sichuan, China. The objective was to predict the likelihood of readmission within 6 months after hospital discharge, considering drug therapy as an influential factor. The study aimed to determine the importance of drugs as features for the outcome and explore the potential inclusion of additional variables in the predictive model.
